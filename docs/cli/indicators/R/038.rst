R038 The ratio of disqualified bids to submitted bids is a high outlier per buyer, procuring entity or tenderer
===============================================================================================================

Methodology
-----------

For each buyer, the ratio is calculated as :math:`numberOfBidsDisqualifiedByBuyer \over numberOfBidsSubmittedToBuyer` across all contracting processes. A buyer is flagged if its ratio is greater than the **upper fence** of :math:`Q_3 + 1.5(IQR)`, where :math:`Q_3` is the third quartile and :math:`IQR` is the interquartile range for the set of ratios. The same calculation is performed for procuring entities.

For each tenderer, the ratio is calculated as :math:`numberOfBidsDisqualifiedForTenderer \over numberOfBidsSubmittedByTenderer` across all contracting processes. A tenderer is flagged if its ratio is greater than the **upper fence** of :math:`Q_3 + 1.5(IQR)`, where :math:`Q_3` is the third quartile and :math:`IQR` is the interquartile range for the set of ratios.

Interpretation
--------------

The indicatorâ€™s value is the ratio.

Configuration
-------------

To configure the upper fence, add to your settings file:

.. code:: ini

   [R038]
   threshold = 0.5

Assumptions
-----------

This indicator assumes that ``buyer/id``, ``procuringEntity/id`` and ``bids/details/tenderers/id`` are stable across contracting processes. `#32 <https://github.com/open-contracting/cardinal-rs/issues/32>`__

The ratio of disqualified bids to submitted bids is a high outlier per buyer, procuring entity or tenderer (R038)
=================================================================================================================

Methodology
-----------

For each buyer, the ratio is calculated as :math:`numberOfBidsDisqualifiedByBuyer \over numberOfBidsSubmittedToBuyer` across all contracting processes. A buyer is flagged if its ratio is greater than the **upper fence** of :math:`Q_3 + 1.5(IQR)`, where :math:`Q_3` is the third quartile and :math:`IQR` is the interquartile range for the set of ratios. The same calculation is performed for procuring entities.

For each tenderer, the ratio is calculated as :math:`numberOfBidsDisqualifiedForTenderer \over numberOfBidsSubmittedByTenderer` across all contracting processes. A tenderer is flagged if its ratio is greater than the **upper fence** of :math:`Q_3 + 1.5(IQR)`, where :math:`Q_3` is the third quartile and :math:`IQR` is the interquartile range for the set of ratios.

   25% (:math:`Q_1`) of buyers in Atlantis disqualify at most 2% of bids received. 75% (:math:`Q_3`) of buyers disqualify at most 22% of bids received. This yields an upper fence of 52%.

   The State Water Corporation disqualified 59% of bids received. This is more than the upper fence of 52%. Therefore, the State Water Corporation is flagged.

   25% (:math:`Q_1`) of bidders in Atlantis have no disqualified bids. 75% (:math:`Q_3`) of bidders have at most 24% disqualified bids. This yields an upper fence of 60%.

   73% of the bids submitted by MisconductCorp were disqualified. This is higher than the upper fence of 60%. Therefore, MisconductCorp is flagged.

.. admonition:: Why is this a red flag?
   :class: hint

   A corrupt buyer or procuring entity can award pre-determined bidders by disqualifying other bidders' bids.

   A colluding bidder can mimic competition by submitting deliberately unqualified bids.

Output
------

The indicatorâ€™s value is the **ratio**, as a decimal.

Configuration
-------------

To configure the **upper fence**, add to your settings file, as a decimal:

.. code:: ini

   [R038]
   threshold = 0.5

Assumptions
-----------

This indicator assumes that ``buyer/id``, ``procuringEntity/id`` and ``bids/details/tenderers/id`` are stable across contracting processes. `#32 <https://github.com/open-contracting/cardinal-rs/issues/32>`__

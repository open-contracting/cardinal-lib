# The percentage difference between the winning bid and the second-lowest valid bid is a low outlier (R024)

## Methodology

For each contracting process, the **difference** is calculated as $(secondLowestValidBidAmount - winningBidAmount) \over winningBidAmount$.

A contracting process is flagged if the difference is less than the **lower fence** of $Q_1 - 1.5(IQR)$, where $Q_1$ is the first quartile and $IQR$ is the interquartile range for the set of differences.

```{admonition} Example
:class: seealso

In 25% ($Q_1$) of contracting processes in Atlantis, the second-lowest valid bid is at most 5% greater than the winning bid. In 75% ($Q_3$) of contracting processes, it is at most 7% greater. This yields a lower fence of 2% (`0.02`).

In a contracting process, CollusionCorp won with a bid of \$100,000, and ProcureManipulate lost with a bid of \$101,000. The difference is 1% (`0.01`). This is less than the lower fence of 2%. Therefore, the process is flagged.
```

```{admonition} Why is this a red flag?
:class: hint

A colluding bidder can mimic competition by submitting a bid that is similar in price (but different in quality, for example) from its colluding partner.
```

## Output

The indicator's value is the **difference**, as a decimal.

## Configuration

To configure the **lower fence**, add to your settings file, as a decimal:

```ini
[R024]
threshold = 0.05
```

## Exclusions

A contracting process is excluded if:

- An awardâ€™s status is pending or invalid.
- The winning bid is not the lowest bid. (This indicator requires the award criteria to be price-only.)
- There are multiple active awards (a.k.a. winning bids). [#14](https://github.com/open-contracting/cardinal-rs/issues/14)
- A bid is submitted by multiple tenderers. [#17](https://github.com/open-contracting/cardinal-rs/issues/17)
- An award is made to multiple suppliers. [#17](https://github.com/open-contracting/cardinal-rs/issues/17)

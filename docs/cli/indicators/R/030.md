# Late bid won (R030)

The winning bid was received after the submission deadline.

## Methodology

A contracting process is flagged if:

- A valid bid's received date is after the submission deadline.
- At least one tenderer of the valid bid is the supplier of an active award.

:::{admonition} Example
:class: seealso

The submission deadline is March 15. The Public Works Department leaks information from the received bids to CorruptX Solutions, to give it a competitive advantage. CorruptX Solutions submits a bid on April 1. The Public Works Department accepts the bid and awards the contract to CorruptX Solutions.
:::

:::{admonition} Why is this a red flag?
:class: hint

A corrupt buyer can award the pre-determined bidder by disregarding the submission deadline.
:::

## Output

The indicator's value is always 1.0.

## Configuration

The indicator is not configurable.

## Exclusions

A contracting process is excluded if:

- An award's status is pending or invalid.

## Assumptions

This indicator assumes that the tenderer didn't submit another valid bid before the submission deadline.

# Bids are disqualified if not submitted by the single tenderer of the winning bid (R035)

## Methodology

A contracting process is flagged if:

- Exactly one tenderer submitted one or more bids that are valid (i.e. qualified).
- The tenderer of the valid bids and the suppliers of all active awards are the same.
- At least 1 other tenderer submitted a bid that was disqualified. (1 is the **threshold**.)

```{admonition} Example
:class: seealso

The National Rail Service received five bids. It disqualified four bids, and awarded the contract to the remaining bid from CorruptX Solutions.
```

```{admonition} Why is this a red flag?
:class: hint

A corrupt buyer can award the pre-determined bidder by disqualifying other bidders' bids.
```

## Output

The indicator’s value is the number of unique tenderers with disqualified bids.

## Configuration

To configure the **threshold**, add to your settings file, as a natural number:

```ini
[R035]
threshold = 1 # default
```

## Exclusions

A contracting process is excluded if:

- An award’s status is pending or invalid.

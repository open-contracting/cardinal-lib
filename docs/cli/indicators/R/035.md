# All except winning bid disqualified (R035)

Bids are disqualified if not submitted by the single tenderer of the winning bid.

:::{seealso}
{doc}`038`
:::

## Methodology

A contracting process is flagged if:

- Exactly one tenderer submitted one or more bids that are valid (i.e. qualified).
- The tenderer of the valid bids and the suppliers of all active awards are the same.
- At least 1 other tenderer submitted a bid that was disqualified. (1 is the **threshold**.)

:::{admonition} Example
:class: seealso

The National Rail Service received five bids. It disqualified four bids, and awarded the contract to the remaining bid from CorruptX Solutions.
:::

:::{admonition} Why is this a red flag?
:class: hint

A corrupt buyer can award the pre-determined bidder by disqualifying other bidders' bids.
:::

<small>Based on "Prevalence of faulty bids" in [*Toolkit for detecting collusive bidding in public procurement*](https://www.govtransparency.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GTI_WP2014_2_Toth_et_al_150413.pdf).</small>

## Output

The indicator's value is the number of unique tenderers with disqualified bids.

## Configuration

All configuration is optional. If you observe many false positives among contracting processes with few submitted bids, you can increase the threshold. To override the default **threshold**, add to your settings file, as a natural number:

```ini
[R035]
threshold = 1 # default
```

## Exclusions

A contracting process is excluded if:

- An award's status is pending or invalid.

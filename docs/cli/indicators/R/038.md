# The ratio of disqualified bids to submitted bids is a high outlier per buyer, procuring entity or tenderer (R038)

## Methodology

For each buyer, the ratio is calculated as $numberOfBidsDisqualifiedByBuyer \over numberOfBidsSubmittedToBuyer$ across all contracting processes. A buyer is flagged if its ratio is greater than the **upper fence** of $Q_3 + 1.5(IQR)$, where $Q_3$ is the third quartile and $IQR$ is the interquartile range for the set of ratios. The same calculation is performed for procuring entities.

For each tenderer, the ratio is calculated as $numberOfBidsDisqualifiedForTenderer \over numberOfBidsSubmittedByTenderer$ across all contracting processes. A tenderer is flagged if its ratio is greater than the **upper fence** of $Q_3 + 1.5(IQR)$, where $Q_3$ is the third quartile and $IQR$ is the interquartile range for the set of ratios.

:::{admonition} Example for a buyer or procuring entity
:class: seealso

25% ($Q_1$) of buyers in Atlantis disqualify at most 2% of bids received. 75% ($Q_3$) of buyers disqualify at most 22% of bids received. This yields an upper fence of 52%.

The State Water Corporation disqualified 59% of bids received. This is more than the upper fence of 52%. Therefore, the State Water Corporation is flagged.

:::{admonition} Example for a tenderer
:class: seealso

25% ($Q_1$) of bidders in Atlantis have no disqualified bids. 75% ($Q_3$) of bidders have at most 24% disqualified bids. This yields an upper fence of 60%.

73% of the bids submitted by MisconductCorp were disqualified. This is higher than the upper fence of 60%. Therefore, MisconductCorp is flagged.

:::{admonition} Why is this a red flag?
:class: hint

A corrupt buyer or procuring entity can award pre-determined bidders by disqualifying other bidders' bids.

A colluding bidder can mimic competition by submitting deliberately unqualified bids.

## Output

The indicator's value is the **ratio**, as a decimal.

## Configuration

To configure the **upper fence**, add to your settings file, as a decimal:

```ini
[R038]
threshold = 0.5
```

## Assumptions

This indicator assumes that `buyer/id`, `procuringEntity/id` and `bids/details/tenderers/id` are stable across contracting processes. [#32](https://github.com/open-contracting/cardinal-rs/issues/32)

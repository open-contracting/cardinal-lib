# Lowest bid disqualified (R036)

The lowest submitted bid is disqualified, while the award criterion is price only.

## Methodology

A contracting process is flagged if:

- There are one or more active awards.
- The lowest submitted bid is disqualified.

:::{admonition} Example
:class: seealso

The Public Works Department sets the award criterion as lowest price. FairDeal Inc. submits a bid of \$100,000. BribeCorp submits a bid of \$111,111. The Public Works Department disqualifies the bid from FairDeal Inc.

:::{admonition} Why is this a red flag?
:class: hint

A corrupt buyer can award the pre-determined bidder by disqualifying lower-priced bids.

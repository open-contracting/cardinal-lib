R035 Bids are disqualified if not submitted by the single tenderer of the winning bid
=====================================================================================

Methodology
-----------

A contracting process is flagged if:

-  Exactly one tenderer submitted one or more bids that are valid (i.e. qualified).

-  The tenderer of the valid bids and the suppliers of all active awards are the same.

-  At least 1 other tenderer submitted a bid that was disqualified. (1 is the **threshold**.)

Interpretation
--------------

The indicator’s value is the number of unique tenderers with disqualified bids.

Configuration
-------------

To configure the threshold, add to your settings file:

.. code:: ini

   [R035]
   threshold = 1 # default

Exclusions
----------

A contracting process is excluded if:

-  An award’s status is pending or invalid.

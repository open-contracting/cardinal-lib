# Short notice to bidders to submit expressions of interest or bids (R003)

The bid period is less than expected per the procurement method used.

## Methodology

For each contracting process, the bid **period** is calculated as $(/tender/tenderPeriod/endDate - /tender/tenderPeriod/startDate)$ in days.

A contracting process is flagged if the period is less than 15 days (15 is the **threshold**).

:::{admonition} Example
:class: seealso

The National Rail Service publish a tender process with a tender period start date set to today and the end date set to tomorrow.
:::

:::{admonition} Why is this a red flag?
:class: hint

A short submission period leaves less time hence make it harder for non-connected companies to bid and to submit; well-connected firms can use its inside knowledge to win repeatedly.

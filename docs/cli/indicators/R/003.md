# Short submission period (R003)

The submission period, during which bidders submit expressions of interest or bids, is shorter than expected for the procurement method used.

## Methodology

For each contracting process, the **submission period** is calculated as $(/tender/tenderPeriod/endDate - /tender/tenderPeriod/startDate)$ in days.

A contracting process is flagged if the period is less than the **threshold** for the given procurement method details. If there is no threshold configured for a specific procurement method detail, or the procurement method detail is not present, the default threshold is used.

:::{admonition} Example
:class: seealso

The National Rail Service publish a tender process with a tender period start date set to today and the end date set to tomorrow.

:::{admonition} Why is this a red flag?
:class: hint

A short submission period leaves less time hence make it harder for non-connected companies to bid and to submit; well-connected firms can use its inside knowledge to win repeatedly.

## Output

The indicator’s value is always 1.0.

## Configuration

All configuration is optional. To override the default threshold:

```ini
[R003]
threshold = 15 # default
```

To set a threshold per procurement method details:

```ini
[R003.procurement_method_details_thresholds]
Cotización = 7
Licitación = 10
Licitación de Seguros = 10
```


## Exclusions

A contracting process is excluded if:
- The procurement method is not open
- The tender procurement method, and tender period start date and end date are not set.

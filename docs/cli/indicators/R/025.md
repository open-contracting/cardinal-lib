# The ratio of winning bids to submitted bids for a top tenderer is a low outlier (R025)

## Methodology

For each tenderer, the **ratio** is calculated as $numberOfWinningBids \over numberOfValidBids$ across all contracting processes.

A tenderer is flagged if:

- Its number of valid bids is greater than the **upper fence** of the third quartile ($Q_3$) of the set of numbers of valid bids.
- Its ratio is less than the **lower fence** of $Q_1 - 1.5(IQR)$, where $Q_1$ is the first quartile and $IQR$ is the interquartile range for the set of ratios.

:::{admonition} Example
:class: seealso

75% ($Q_3$) of bidders in Atlantis submitted at most 100 bids. UnethicalBid Ltd. submitted 150 bids. This is greater than the upper fence of 100. Therefore, UnethicalBid Ltd. is a top tenderer.

25% ($Q_1$) of bidders in Atlantis win at most half (`0.5`) of their bids. 75% ($Q_3$) of bidders win at most three quarters (`0.75`) of their bids. This yields a lower fence of one eighth (`0.125`).

UnethicalBid Ltd. won 15 of its 150 bids, or one tenth (`0.1`). This is less than the lower fence of one eighth. Therefore, UnethicalBid Ltd. is flagged.

:::{admonition} Why is this a red flag?
:class: hint

A colluding bidder can mimic competition by submitting deliberately losing bids (at inflated bid prices, for example) in contracting processes in which a colluding partner participates.

## Output

The indicator's value is the **ratio**, as a decimal.

## Configuration

To configure the **upper fence**, add to your settings file, as a percentage:

```ini
[R025]
percentile = 75 # default
```

To configure the **lower fence**, add to your settings file, as a decimal:

```ini
[R025]
threshold = 0.05
```

## Exclusions

A contracting process is excluded if:

- An awardâ€™s status is pending or invalid.
- There are multiple active awards (a.k.a. winning bids). [#14](https://github.com/open-contracting/cardinal-rs/issues/14)
- A bid is submitted by multiple tenderers. [#17](https://github.com/open-contracting/cardinal-rs/issues/17)
- An award is made to multiple suppliers. [#17](https://github.com/open-contracting/cardinal-rs/issues/17)

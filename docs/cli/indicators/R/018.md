# Single bid received (R018)

Only one tenderer submitted a bid.

## Methodology

For each contracting process, the number of tenderers is taken from $/tender/numberOfTenderers$.

A contracting process is flagged if only one tenderer submitted a bid.

The Ministry of Education publishes an open tender and receives only one bid.

:::{admonition} Why is this a red flag?
:class: hint

Single bid tenders make it easier for buyers to award contracts to the same well-connected company repeatedly.  A single bid is also considered a signal of corruption risk or an output of a fraudulent procedure.

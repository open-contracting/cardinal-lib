"For each tenderer, the **variety** is calculated as the number of distinct "
"first-level classifications across all items awarded to the tenderer, across"
" all contracting processes. A tenderer is flagged if its variety is greater "
"than or equal to the **upper fence** of $Q_3 + 1.5(IQR)$, where $Q_3$ is the"
" third quartile and $IQR$ is the interquartile range for the set of "
"varieties among tenderers awarded in at least 20 contracting processes."
